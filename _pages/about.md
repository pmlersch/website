I am Associate Professor of Sociology of Social Policy in the [Department of Social Sciences](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/index.html?set_language=en) at [Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en?set_language=en) and Senior Research Fellow at the [German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin)](https://www.diw.de/en). My [research group](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/sozpolsoz/research/mywealth_eng/research?set_language=en) on personal wealth accumulation in couples is funded by the Emmy Noether Programme of the [German Research Foundation](https://www.dfg.de/en/index.jsp).

My main research interests are in social inequalities over and between life courses of individuals in divergent institutional contexts focusing on the family, wealth and employment. I mainly work with longitudinal survey data.
